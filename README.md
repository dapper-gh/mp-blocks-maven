**Notes for the reader**

This project implements a number of types that operate on rectangular blocks of text.
These include `VComp` and `HComp`, which compose one or more blocks of text vertically
and horizontally, respectively. Other blocks can be found in the
`src/main/java/edu/grinnell/csc207/blocks` directory. We have also made "art" using
these blocks, which can be found at `src/main/java/edu/grinnell/csc207/main/Art80x24.java`.
